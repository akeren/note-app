# Node JS File System and Command Line Args (Notes App)

This is a note-taking application developed with the very core of Node JS. It is basically a command-line application. The data storage is in a file format in JSON form. The app was developed in the course of teaching Students Node JS at Batech ICT & Computers, Makurdi.

## Workthrough

- Getting Input from Users
- Argument Parsing with Yargs
- Storing Data with JSON
- Adding a note
- Removing a note
- Listing Notes
- Reading a Note
